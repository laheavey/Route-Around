Unlike most buildings in downtown Minneapolis, there are no \'skyways\' connecting the city hall to the rest of the city. Public pedestrian tunnels connect the building to the Hennepin County Government Center under 5th Street, and to the U.S. Courthouse under 4th Street.  Inside, on the 4th Street side, there is a large five-story rotunda including a large sculpture, \'Father of Waters,\' by American sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead who lived in Florence, Italy at the time. According to legend, rubbing his big toe brings good luck. It was placed inside the building in 1906. '),
